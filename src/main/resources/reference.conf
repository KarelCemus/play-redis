# Redis cache configuration
# ===================
play.cache.redis {

  # default redis connection settings, for more options see below

  # redis server: host
  host:       localhost
  # redis server: port
  port:       6379
  # redis server: database number
  database:   0

  # there are two ways to configure redis instances.
  #
  # for most users the first option is sufficient, it covers
  # over 90% of cases. It uses single either standalone or
  # cluster default cache. In this case, you can configure
  # the cache directly under the 'play.cache.redis' key.
  # The cache name is defined in 'play.cache.redis.default-cache'.
  #
  # for example:
  #
  # play.cache.redis {
  #   # redis server: host
  #   host:       localhost
  #   # redis server: port
  #   port:       6379
  #   # redis server: database number
  #   database:   0
  # }
  #
  # for more advanced settings such as a cluster or connection
  # string see below.
  #
  #
  #
  # for advanced users, there is the second way to configure
  # the instances through the list of named instances.
  #
  # you can defined 'instances' node, which is
  # a map of name-configuration tuples. The name determines
  # the name of the cache, configuration defines the settings.
  # You can combine it with 'bind-default' and 'default-cache' keys.
  #
  # the configuration loader switches into this advanced mode
  # automatically when the 'instances' key is defined. In that case,
  # cache defined directly under 'play.cache.redis' is ignored.
  #
  # for details about named caches see https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.6.x/ScalaCache#Accessing-different-caches
  #
  # for example:
  #
  #
  # instances {
  #
  #  # definition of the default cache, its name is
  #  # defined in 'play.cache.redis.default-cache'
  #  play {

  #   ##########################
  #
  #   # list of nodes in a cluster either [] or null. Intentional use:
  #   #
  #   # cluster:  [
  #   #   # nodes are defined as a sequence of objects:
  #   #   {
  #   #     # required string, defining a host the node is running on
  #   #     host:        localhost
  #   #     # required integer, defining a port the node is running on
  #   #     port:        6379
  #   #     # optional string, defines a password to use
  #   #     password:    null
  #   #   }
  #   # ]
  #   #
  #   # To enable the cluster, set 'source' variable to 'cluster'
  #   #
  #   # Note: When cluster is set, the 'host', 'port',
  #   # and 'database' properties does not apply.

  #   # Connection string mode
  #   ##########################
  #
  #   # When the application is running in PaaS, it is
  #   # often required to configure the redis from the connection
  #   # string in the environmental variable. Play's configuration
  #   # resolves environmental variables through ${VARIABLE}, e.g.,
  #   # to run this library on Heroku, set 'connection-string'
  #   # variable to either '${REDIS_URL}' or '${REDISCLOUD_URL}'
  #   # depending on your PaaS configuration.
  #   #
  #   # The connection string can be also written statically thought
  #   # it is intended for the use with environmental variables.
  #   #
  #   # Note: To consider a 'connection-string' variable, set 'source'
  #   # to 'connection-string'.
  #   #
  #   connection-string:    null
  #  }
  # }

  # configuration source. This library supports multiple types of
  # redis configuration provideres as well as it supports both
  # standalone instances and clusters. To simplify the configuration
  # and make it more explicit, 'source' property determines the intended
  # type of the instance. By default, each instance is considered
  # statically configured standalone redis server. However, supported values
  # are:
  #  - 'standalone' mode indicates a use of 'host', 'port', 'password'
  #      and 'database' variables
  #  - 'cluster' mode indicates use of 'cluster' variable defining nodes
  #  - 'connection-string' mode is usually used with PaaS as setup by the
  #      environment. It consideres 'connection-string' property.
  #  - 'custom' indicates that the user supplies his own RedisInstance configuration
  #
  # Default value is 'standalone'
  #
  # note: this is global definition, can be locally overriden for each
  # cache instance. To do so, redefine this property
  # under 'play.cache.redis.instances.instance-name.this-property'.

  # synchronization timeout applies only with synchronous API. It does not
  # apply with asynchronous API and you are free to ignore it. This value
  # is used with `Await.result`.
  #
  # note: this is global definition, can be locally overriden for each
  # cache instance. To do so, redefine this property
  # under 'play.cache.redis.instances.instance-name.this-property'.
  #

  # connection timeout applies only when the connection to redis is not established.
  # When defined, it determines the maximal timeout before the future is
  # either resolved or rejected.
  #
  # note: this is global definition, can be locally overriden for each
  # cache instance. To do so, redefine this property
  # under 'play.cache.redis.instances.instance-name.this-property'.

  connection-timeout:     500ms

  # the redis usually returns the reponse very quickly but sometimes the
  # requests stuck, the answer takes long time or the redis is
  # disconnected. In all these cases the response may take
  # very long time (minutes) or possibly won't return at all.
  #
  # this timeout indicates the maximum waiting time for
  # the request. If the reponse is not returned within this timeout,
  # the exception is thrown and then the recovery policy applies.
  #
  # note: by default, for the performance reasons, the timeout is disabled.
  # if you expect possible delayed responses from the redis or encounter
  # these issues, enable this timeout setting it, e.g., to 1 minute.
  #
  # note: this is global definition, can be locally overriden for each
  # cache instance. To do so, redefine this property
  # under 'play.cache.redis.instances.instance-name.this-property'.
  #
  redis-timeout:    null

  # each instance can apply its own prefix to all keys it works with.
  # This enables, e.g., use of multiple instances with the same redis
  # database under the hood. There are two intended use cases:
  #
  #   1. two named instances with the same database
  #   2. to avoid conflicts when there is also another application accessing the cache
  #
  # With named caches, this value may and should be locally overriden under
  # 'play.cache.redis.instances.instance-name.this-property'.

  # invocation policy applies in methods `getOrElse`. It determines
  # whether to wait until the `set` completes or return eagerly the
  # computed value. Valid values:
  #  - 'lazy':  for lazy invocation waiting for the `set` completion
  #  - 'eager': for eager invocation returning the computed on miss
  #             without waiting for the `set` completion. Eager
  #             invocation ignores the error in `set`, if occurs.
  #
  # Default value is 'lazy' to properly handle errors, if occurs.
  #
  # note: this is global definition, can be locally overriden for each
  # cache instance. To do so, redefine this property

  # The intention of cache is usually to optimize the application behavior,
  # not to provide any business logic, i.e., it makes sense the cache could
  # be removed without any visible change except for possible performance loss.
  #
  # In consequence, we think that failed cache requests should not break the
  # application flow by emitting the exception, it should be logged and ignored.
  # However, not always this is desired behavior. To resolve this ambiguity,
  # we provide `RecoveryPolicy` trait implementing the behavior to be executed
  # when the cache request  fails. By default, we provide two implementations:
  #
  # 'log-and-fail':       Logs the error at firts and then emits RedisException
  #
  # 'log-and-default':    Logs the error at first and then returns operation
  #                       neutral value, which should look like there is no
  #                       cache in use.
  #
  # 'custom':             User provides his own binding to implementation of `RecoveryPolicy`
  #
  #
  # Besides logging and re-populating the exceptions, it is also possible to
  # send email or re-run the failed command, which could like like certain robustness.
  #
  # note: this is global definition, can be locally overriden for each
  # cache instance. To do so, redefine this property
  # under 'play.cache.redis.instances.instance-name.this-property'.

  # named cache. This applies only with Guice.
