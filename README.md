By default, [Play framework 2](http://playframework.com/) is delivered with EHCache module implementing
[CacheApi](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/api/scala/index.html#play.api.cache.CacheApi).
This module enables use of the **redis-server**, i.e., key/value cache, within the
Play framework 2. Besides the backward compatibility with the [CacheApi](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/api/scala/index.html#play.api.cache.CacheApi),
it introduces more evolved API providing various handful operations. Besides the basic methods such as
`get`, `set` and `remove`, it provides more convenient methods such as `expire`, `exists`, `invalidate` and much more. 
As the cache implementation uses Akka actor system, it is **completely non-blocking and asynchronous**.
Furthermore, we deliver the library with several configuration providers to let you easily use 
play-redis on Heroku as well as on your premise.

## Provided APIs

This library delivers a single module with following implementations of the API. While the core
of the framework is fully non-blocking, most of provided facades are *blocking wrappers*.

 1. `play.api.cache.redis.CacheApi` (*blocking* Scala implementation)
 2. `play.api.cache.redis.CacheAsyncApi` (non-blocking Scala implementation)
 3. `play.api.cache.CacheApi` (Play's *blocking* API for Scala)
 4. `play.cache.CacheApi` (Play's *blocking* API for Java)

First, the `CacheApi` is extended `play.api.cache.CacheApi` and it implements the connection in the **blocking** manner.
Second, the `CacheAsyncApi` enables **non-blocking** connection providing results through `scala.concurrent.Future`.
Third, the synchronous implementation also implements standard `CacheApi` bundled within Play framework. Finally,
the `play.cache.CacheApi` is implementation of standard `CacheApi` for Java.


## How to add the module into the project

This module builds over [Brando connector](https://github.com/chrisdinn/brando) and is intended **only for Scala version**
of the Play framework.

To your SBT `build.sbt` add the following lines:

```scala
// redis-server cache
libraryDependencies += "com.github.karelcemus" %% "play-redis" % "1.3.0"

// repository with the Brando connector
resolvers += "Brando Repository" at "http://chrisdinn.github.io/releases/"
```

Now we **must enable our redis** cache module and **disable default Play's EhCache** module. Into `application.conf` and following
two lines:

```
# disable default Play framework cache plugin
play.modules.disabled += "play.api.cache.EhCacheModule"

# enable redis cache module
play.modules.enabled += "play.api.cache.redis.RedisCacheModule"
```

## How to use this module

When you have the library added to your project, you can safely inject the `play.api.cache.redis.CacheApi` trait
for the synchronous cache. If you want the asynchronous implementation, then inject `play.api.cache.redis.CacheAsyncApi`.
There might be some limitations with data types but it should not be anything major. (Note: it uses Akka serialization.
Supported data types are primitives, objects serializable through the java serialization and collections.)
If you encounter any issue, **please feel free to report it**.

**Example:**

```scala
import scala.concurrent.Future
import scala.concurrent.duration._

import play.api.cache.redis.CacheApi

class MyController @Inject() ( cache: CacheApi ) {

  cache.set( "key", "value" )
  // returns Option[ T ] where T stands for String in this example
  cache.get[ String ]( "key" )
  cache.remove( "key" )

  cache.set( "object", MyCaseClass() )
  // returns Option[ T ] where T stands for MyCaseClass
  cache.get[ MyCaseClass ]( "object" )

  // returns Unit
  cache.set( "key", 1.23 )

  // returns Option[ Double ]
  cache.get[ Double ]( "key" )
  // returns Option[ MyCaseClass ]
  cache.get[ MyCaseClass ]( "object" )

  // returns T where T is Double. If the value is not in the cache
  // the computed result is saved
  cache.getOrElse( "key" )( 1.24 )

  // same as getOrElse but works for Futures. It returns Future[ T ]
  cache.getOrFuture( "key" )( Future( 1.24 ) )

  // returns Unit and removes a key/keys from the storage
  cache.remove( "key" )
  cache.remove( "key1", "key2" )
  cache.remove( "key1", "key2", "key3" )
  // remove all expects a sequence of keys, it performs same be behavior
  // as remove methods, they are just syntax sugar
  cache.removeAll( "key1", "key2", "key3" )

  // removes all keys in the redis database! Beware using it
  cache.invalidate()

  // refreshes expiration of the key if present
  cache.expire( "key", 1.second )

  // returns true if the key is in the storage, false otherwise
  cache.exists( "key" )

  // returns all keys matching given pattern. Beware, complexity is O(n),
  // where n is the size of the database. It executes KEYS command.
  cache.matching( "page/1/*" )

  // removes all keys matching given pattern. Beware, complexity is O(n),
  // where n is the size of the database. It internally uses method matching.
  // It executes KEYS and DEL commands in a transaction.
  cache.removeMatching( "page/1/*" )

  // importing `play.api.cache.redis._` enables us
  // using both `java.util.Date` and `org.joda.time.DateTime` as expiration
  // dates instead of duration. These implicits are useful when
  // we know the data regularly changes, e.g., at midnight, at 3 AM, etc.
  // We do not have compute the duration ourselves, the library
  // can do it for us
  import play.api.cache.redis._
  cache.set( "key", "value", DateTime.parse( "2015-12-01T00:00" ).asExpiration )
}
```

## Checking operation result

Regardless of current API, all operations throw an exception when fail. Consequently,
successful invocations do not throw an exception. The only difference is in checking for errors.
While synchronous APIs really throw an exception, asynchronous API returns a `Future`
wrapping both the success and the exception, i.e., use `onFailure` or `onComplete` to
check for errors.

## Configuration

There is already default configuration but it can be overwritten in your `conf/application.conf` file.

| Key                                 | Type     | Default                         | Description                         |
|-------------------------------------|---------:|--------------------------------:|-------------------------------------|
| play.cache.redis.host               | String   | `localhost`                     | redis-server address                |
| play.cache.redis.port               | Int      | `6379`                          | redis-server port                   |
| play.cache.redis.database           | Int      | `1`                             | redis-server database, 1-15         |
| play.cache.redis.timeout            | Duration | `1s`                            | connection timeout                  |
| play.cache.redis.dispatcher         | String   | `akka.actor.default-dispatcher` | Akka actor                          |
| play.cache.redis.configuration      | String   | `static`                        | Defines which configuration source enable. Accepted values are `static`, `env`, `custom` |
| play.cache.redis.password           | String   | `null`                          | When authentication is required, this is the password. Value is optional. |
| play.cache.redis.connection-string-variable | String   | `REDIS_URL`             | Name of the environment variable with the connection string. This is used in combination with the `env` configuration. This allows customization of the variable name in PaaS environment. Value is optional. |
| play.cache.redis.recovery           | String   | `log-and-default`               | Defines behavior when command execution fails. Accepted values are `log-and-fail` to log the error and rethrow the exception, `log-and-default` to log the failure and return default value neutral to the operation, and 'custom' indicating the user binds his own implementation of `RecoveryPolicy`. |

### Recovery policy

The intention of cache is usually to optimize the application behavior, not to provide any business logic.
In this case it makes sense the cache could be removed without any visible change except for possible
performance loss. In consequence, we think that **failed cache requests should not break the application flow**,
they should be logged and ignored. However, not always this is desired behavior. To resolve this ambiguity,
we provide `RecoveryPolicy` trait implementing the behavior to be executed when the cache request  fails.
By default, we provide two implementations. They both log the failure at first and while one produces
the exception and let the application to deal with it, the other returns some neutral value, which
should result in behavior like there is no cache. However, besides these, it is possible, e.g., to also
rerun a failed command. For more information see `RecoveryPolicy` trait.

### Connection settings on different platforms

In various environments there are various sources of the connection string defining how to connect to Redis instance.
For example, at localhost we are interested in direct definition of host and port in the `application.conf` file.
However, this approach does not fit all environments. For example, Heroku supplies `REDISCLOUD_URL` environment variable
defining the connection string. To resolve this diversity, the library expects an implementation of the `Configuration`
trait available through DI. By default, it enables `static` configuration source, i.e., it reads the settings from the
static configuration file. Another supplied configuration reader is `env`, which reads the environment variable such as
`REDIS_URL` but the variable name is configurable. To easy use on Heroku, we also provide `heroku` configuration
profile expecting `REDISCLOUD_URL` variable. To disable built-in providers you are free to set `custom` and supply your
own implementation of the `Configuration` trait.

### Running on Heroku

To enable redis cache on Heroku we have to do the following steps:

 1. add library into application dependencies
 2. enable `RedisCacheModule`
 3. disable `EhCacheModule`
 4. set `play.cache.redis.configuration: heroku`, which expects `REDISCLOUD_URL` environment variable
 5. done, we can run it and use any of 3 provided interfaces

### Custom configuration source

However, there are scenarios when we need to customize the configuration to better fit our needs. Usually,
we might encounter this when we have a specific development flow or use a specific PaaS. To enable redis cache
implementation with customized configuration we have to do the following steps:

 1. add library into application dependencies
 2. enable `RedisCacheModule`
 3. disable `EhCacheModule`
 4. set `play.cache.redis.configuration: custom`
 5. Implement `play.api.cache.redis.Configuration` trait
 6. Register the implementation into DI provider. This is specific for each provider. If you are using Guice, which is
 Play's default DI provider, then look [here](https://playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/ScalaDependencyInjection#Advanced:-Extending-the-GuiceApplicationLoader).
 It gives you a hint how to register the implementation during application start.
 7. done, we can run it and use any of 3 provided interfaces

## Caveat

The library **does not enable** the redis module by default. It is to avoid conflict with Play's default EhCache.
The Play discourages disabling modules within the library thus it leaves it up to developers to disable EhCache
and enable Redis manually. This also allows you to use EhCache in your *dev* environment and redis in *production*.
Nevertheless, this module **replaces** the EHCache and it is not intended to use both implementations along.

## Changelog

### [:link: 1.3.0](https://github.com/KarelCemus/play-redis/tree/1.3.0) (Possibly breaking)

Major internal code refactoring, library has been modularized into several packages.
However, **public API remained unchanged**, although its implementation significantly
changed.

Added `heroku` configuration profile simplifying [running on Heroku](#running-on-heroku).

Introduced [`RecoveryPolicy`](#recovery-policy) defining behavior when execution fails. Default
policy is `log-and-default`. To re-enable previous *fail-on-error* behavior, set `log-and-fail`.
See the [`RecoveryPolicy`](#recovery-policy) for more details.


### [:link: 1.2.0](https://github.com/KarelCemus/play-redis/tree/1.2.0)

Play-redis provides native serialization support to basic data types such as String, Int, etc.
However, for other objects including collections, it used to use default `JavaSerializer` serializer.
Since Akka 2.4.1, default `JavaSerializer` is [officially considered inefficient for production use](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/18552).
Nevertheless, to keep things simple, play-redis **still uses this inefficient serializer NOT to enforce** any serialization
library to end users. Although, it recommends [kryo serializer](https://github.com/romix/akka-kryo-serialization) claiming
great performance and small output stream. Any serialization library can be smoothly connected through Akka
configuration, see the [official Akka documentation](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/serialization.html).

This release is focused on library refactoring. While **public API remained unchanged**, there are several significant
changes to their implementations. Those are consequences of refactoring some functionality into self-standing
units. For example, there has been extracted `RedisConnector` implementing the [Redis protocol](http://redis.io/commands)
and `RedisCache` implementing cache API over that. Before, it was tangled together. As consequence, the library has
now layered architecture (facades -> cache implementation -> protocol implementation) with several public facades.

### [:link: 1.1.0](https://github.com/KarelCemus/play-redis/tree/1.1.0)

Update to Play 2.5, no significant changes

### [:link: 1.0.0](https://github.com/KarelCemus/play-redis/tree/1.0.0)

Redesigned the library from scratch to support Play 2.4.x API and use DI.
